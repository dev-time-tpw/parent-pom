# SNAPSHOT build workflow
# 
# Every time a change is made on any branch, a SNAPSHOT maven build is triggered,
# which compiles the current change and deploys the resulting SNAPSHOT artifact,
# provided a plugin is included in the pom.xml to deploy the artifact.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Use of the artifactory-maven-plugin plugin.
# - User of the artifactory stored in the secrets under ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME
# - Token of the user of the artifactory stored in the secrets under ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN
#
# This job is triggered with every change.
